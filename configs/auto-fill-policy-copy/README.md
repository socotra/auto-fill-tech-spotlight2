# Auto-Fill Policy Copy

This demo uses the default config, and merely adds a simple auto-fill script for vehicle copying. Product config is set to allow the specification of a "Rewrite" policy type, which allows you to specify a reference policy locator that will be used as the basis for the creation of the new policy.
